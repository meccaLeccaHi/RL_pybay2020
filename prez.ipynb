    "## Missing unique identifiers\n",
    "- Records on people or businesses is often very 'messy' with inconsistent formatting from one database to the next.\n",
    "- This makes finding unique matches unlikely. Instead, for each record there is a handful of plausible matches, each matching to a varying degree.\n",
    "## Computational complexity\n",
    "- Because any time you're working with Cartesian products you are working with a quadratic time complexity ($0(n^2)$), intelligent sub-setting of your data (via 'blocking') becomes essential.\n",
    "## Lack of training labels\n",
    "- Due to the expense of hand-labeling training data, we often need to use an unsupervised approach to RL.\n",
    "## Privacy\n",
    "- In spite of our attempts to keep nice, complete databases, people still demand privacy (go figure).\n",

    "- Ensuring consistent formatting\n",
    "## Indexing (blocking)\n",
    "- To reduce the complexity of the task by beginning with smaller subsets of data that are very likely to contain matching records.\n",
    "## Comparison and classification\n",
    "- Classification of each record pair into 'matches' and 'non-matches' can be performed using either a deterministic (rule-based) or probabilistic (model-based) approach.\n",
    "- In the probabilistic approach, comparisons between pairs are broken down into feature vectors summarizing their agreement along multiple dimensions, both simple (e.g. name, address, D.O.B.) and complex (e.g. distance between addresses).\n",
    "- With those feature vectors, we can apply any one of hundreds of different classification models to attempt to predict whether those records are 'matches' or not.\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
